Technical assessment - Backend developer
===

## 🗺️ Context

You’re working on a multi-tenant ticketing platform. The client wants tenants (organisers) to be able to link their personal payment provider account ([mollie](https://www.mollie.com/) or [Ingenico](https://www.ingenico.com/)) to process payments. When an attendee buys a ticket from an organiser, the payment provider chosen by the organiser must be used to handle the checkout. In this first iteration though, we’ll only support mollie. Ingenico will be added in a later phase.

Restrictions:
- An organiser can only link a single payment provider account.

## ⚒️ Minimal requirements

- Use PHP

## 💻 Assessment

Using PHP, implement the payment provider connection setup (using OAuth) and the checkout process. 

## 🎯 Scope 

Focus on the mollie integration, but make sure the code is easily extendible to add support for Ingenico later on.

We’ve sent you an invite for our mollie organisation. Accept the invitation, verify your email and you should be good to go. There’s a mollie app called `Technical assessment` under `Developer > Your apps` which you can use for this assessment.

> 💡 If you had to create a new mollie account, you may have to click the join URL in the invitation email again after verifying your email address in order to see the organisation.

If you have any questions regarding the assessment (or didn’t get the mollie invite), you can open an issue and mention [@remipelhate](https://github.com/remipelhate)).

## 🕦 Timing

You have 3 weeks to accomplish the assessment. How much time and effort you invest in it is totally up to you. But make sure it is good :) When you're done, you can request a review from [@remipelhate](https://github.com/remipelhate).
